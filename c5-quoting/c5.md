* In a Bash script, when we quote a string, we set it apart and protect its literal meaning.
* ("$variable"), that is, replacing the variable with its value
* Double quote presents itself as a single word
  ```console
  for a in $List     # Splits the variable in parts at whitespace.
  do
    echo "$a"
  done
  # one
  # two
  # three

  echo "---"

  for a in "$List"   # Preserves whitespace in a single variable.
  do #     ^     ^
    echo "$a"
  done
  # one two three
  ```

* Special meanings of certain escaped characters

  ```console
  \n
  means newline
  \r
  means return
  \t
  means tab
  \v
  means vertical tab
  \b
  means backspace
  \a
  means alert (beep or flash)
  ```
