* Bash sees [[ $a -lt $b ]] as a single element, which returns an exit status.
* With version 2.02, Bash introduced the [[ ... ]] extended test command, which performs comparisons in a manner more familiar to programmers from other languages. Note that [[ is a keyword, not acommand.
* The (( ... )) and let ... constructs return an exit status, according to whether the arithmetic expressions they evaluate expand to a non-zero value. These arithmetic-expansion constructs may therefore be used to perform arithmetic comparisons.
* If statement
  ```console
  if [ condition-true ]
  then
    command 1
    command 2
    ...
  else  # Or else ...
        # Adds default code block executing if original condition tests false.
    command 3
    command 4
    ...
  fi
  # One Line
  if [ -x "$filename" ]; then
  # Else If
  if [ condition1 ]
  then
    command1
    command2
    command3
  elif [ condition2 ]
  # Same as else if
  then
    command4
    command5
  else
    default-command
  fi
  ```

* If, for some reason, you wish to use /usr/bin/test in a Bash script, then specify it by full pathname.

## File Test Operators
* -lt  -- less than
  * if [ "\$a" -lt "\$b" ]
* < --  less than within parentheses
  * (("\$a" < "\$b"))
