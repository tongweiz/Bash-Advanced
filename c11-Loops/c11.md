## For loops
* for arg in [list] -- This is the basic looping construct.\
  ```console
  for arg in [list]
  do
  command(s)...
  done
  ```
* Operating on files with a for loop
* **While**
  ```console
  while [ condition
  do
  command(s)...
  done
  ```
* **until** -- This construct tests for a condition at the top of a loop, and keeps looping as long as that condition is false (opposite of while loop).
  ```console
  until [ condition-is-true ]
  do
  command(s)...
  done
  ```
* Commands affecting loop behavior
  * **break, continue** -- The break and continue loop control commands [53] correspond exactly to their counterparts in other programming languages. The break command terminates the loop (breaks out of it), while continue causes a jump to the next iteration of the loop, skipping all the remaining commands in that particular loop cycle.
* **Case and branching** grammer
  ```console
  case "$variable" in

  "$condition1" )
  command...
  ;;

  "$condition2" )
  command...
  ;;

  esac
  ```
* **Select** grammer
  ```console
  select variable [in list]
  do
  command...
   break
  done
  ```
